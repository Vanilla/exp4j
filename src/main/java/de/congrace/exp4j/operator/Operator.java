/**
 * This class is used to create custom operators for use in expressions<br/> The applyOperation(double[] values) will have to be implemented by users of this class. <br/> <b>Example</b><br/>
 * <code><pre>
 *     {@code} Operator greaterEq = new Operator(">=", true, 4, 2) { double
 *     applyOperation(double[] values) { if (values[0] >= values[1]){ return 1d; }else{ return 0d; } }
 *     }; Calculable calc = new ExpressionBuilder("1>=2").withOperation(greaterEq).build();
 *     assertTrue(0d == calc.calculate());
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * When constructing {@link Operator} special attention has to be given to the precedence of the operation. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations. The precendence values for the builtin
 * operators are as follows: <br/> Addition and Subtraction (+,-) have precedence 1<br/> Division Multiplication, and Modulo (/,*,%) have precedence 3<br/> Exponentiation (^) has precendence 5 <br/>
 * Unary minus and plus (+1,-1) have precedence 7
